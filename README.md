# Customer Segmentation Modelling


Customer segmentation with K Means and Decision Tree for Clusters Interpretation

In this project, I model a customer segmentation model using real customer data from a physical FMCG store. The data consist of 2000 member customer's data such as their settlement size, income, age, marital status, and sex. The model try to cluster customers into 6 clusters and provided an explanation of who each cluster are. Customer segmentation is supposed to help management and stakeholders create a more efficient strategy in marketing.
